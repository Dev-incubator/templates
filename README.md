## Gulp Template
Install dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
Start project:
```sh
gulp
```

✨Tips:✨
- Work with your project in `src`
- Don't change imports in `index.html`

ToDo:
1) Add auto file deleting from `dist` when you delete them from `src`.
2) Add auto import script and styles in `index.html`.
